### R packages:

- _Developed and maintained:_
  
   - [iQRAT](https://github.com/tianyingw/iQRAT) _(Integrated Quantile RAnk Test)_: The R package iQRAT provides an efficient quantile rank test for heterogeneous association in sequencing study. It implements the method from [Integrated Quantile RAnk Test (iQRAT) for heterogeneous joint effect of rare and common variants in sequencing studies (2019+)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10102).

   - [DAP](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DAP/index.html) _(Discriminant Analysis via Projection)_: The R package DAP provides tools for high-dimensional binary classification in the case of unequal covariance matrices. It implements the method from the following paper:
[Sparse quadratic classification rules via linear dimension reduction by Gaynanova and Wang (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04817).

  - [CCP](https://github.com/tianyingw/CCP) _(Categorize a Continuous Predictor)_: The R package CCP provides tools for correcting the bias due to measurement error when the continuous risk predictor is categorized. The package includes logistic and linear regression, considering when external data are or are not provided. It implements the method from [categorizing a continuous predictor subject to measurement error (2018)](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ejs/1544518836).
    

- _Contributed:_

  - [deconvolve](https://rdrr.io/github/TimothyHyndman/deconvolve/man/deconvolve-package.html): The R package deconvolve provides tools for performing non-parametric deconvolution on measurement error problems. It contains functions for finding bandwidths, deconvolved densities and non-parametric regression estimates.
