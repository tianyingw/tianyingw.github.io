   I work in **quantile regression**, **measurement error analysis**, **semi-parametric analysis** and **high dimensional statistics**. The applications of my research include genetic and genomic data analysis (e.g., GWAS, TWAS and sequencing analysis), microbiome data analysis and epidemiologic research. My career goal is to develop and promote robust statistical learning methods to advance the science of public health and medicine.
   
  In todayâ€™s era of large-scale data, I believe robust statistical learning methods are necessary and important to handle the data heteroscedasticity.  As a result, I focus on jointly analyzing different sources of data and examining different quantiles or subgroups of the population. Combining different data sets leads to more powerful analysis, and examining different subgroups helps give us a more comprehensive view of the entire population, further contributing to more precise analysis of the genetic effect and supporting personalized precision medicine.
