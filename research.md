My primary research is centered around developing statistical theories and methodologies to promote statistical learning to advance the science of public health. Methodologically, I work in **quantile regression**, **measurement error analysis**, **semi-parametric analysis**, and **high-dimensional statistics**. Much of my methodology research applies to genetic and genomic data analysis, microbiome data analysis, epidemiologic research, and environmental data analysis. My recent research work is summarized below.
   

### Quantile-based inference for heterogeneous genetic association studies

The first thread of my research focuses on the quantile regression model for nonlinear heterogeneous genetic association studies, which serves as a complementary to existing methods based on linear regression, leading to innovative discoveries on local nonlinear gene-trait associations and identifications of high-risk subgroups.

### Flexible Statistical Modeling with Zero-inflated Data

The second thread of my research focuses on robust statistical modeling in zero-inflated data, such as microbiome count data, single-cell data, and natural history data for rare diseases. My research utilizes the feature of zero inflation and advances novel learning methods, which results in significant improvement of the test power and estimation accuracy.

### Statistical Models for Measurement Error Analysis

The third thread of my work focuses on addressing error-in-variable issues in environmental statistics, which enables us to correctly estimate scaling factors of the fingerprints in the climate system and provide valid statistical inferences for the attribution and detection analyses of climate change.
