<p align="justify">
With the increasingly large and complex data generated and need to be analyzed, statistics is highly interdisciplinary and rapidly expanding among the sciences. My career goal includes developing state-of-art statistical and machine learning methods for solving data-driven problems, advancing statistical theory in the emerging field of data science, and harnessing real-world evidence for decision-making and precision medicine. 
</p> 

<p align="justify">
My primary research is centered around developing statistical theories and methodologies to promote statistical learning in complex data, especially on data heterogeneity and model interpretability. Much of my methodology research applies to genetic and genomic data analysis, microbiome data analysis, epidemiologic research, and environmental statistics. 
</p> 


### Quantile-based inference for heterogeneous genetic association studies
<p align="justify">
The first thread of my research focuses on nonlinear heterogeneous genetic association studies based on quantile regression, which is complementary to existing methods based on linear regression, leading to innovative discoveries on local nonlinear gene-trait associations and identifications of high-risk subgroups.

### Novel statistical methods for handling zero-inflated data
<p align="justify">
The second thread of my research focuses on robust statistical modeling in zero-inflated data, which is commonly seen in various studies, such as microbiome data analysis. My work is more robust and utilizes the data generation rationale of the zeros, resulting in significant improvement of the test power and estimation accuracy.

### Statistical analyses on the errors-in-variables issue with complex data
<p align="justify">
The third thread of my work focuses on addressing error-in-variable issues with complex structured data, such as in environmental statistics. My recent work on climate data analysis enables us to correctly estimate scaling factors of the fingerprints in the climate system and provide valid statistical inferences for the attribution and detection analyses of climate change.
