title: Undergraduate Student Research Training
---

Welcome! I have supervised ten undergraduate students at Tsinghua University with various research training projects, including statistical methodologies on modeling zero-inflated data, multivariate regression, low-rank approximation, genetic association studies, etc. Here are some examples. More on the way!

## Modeling zero-inflated data with error-in-variables

- **Student's name:** Roulan Jiang. (This work was conducted when Roulan was a senior at Tsinghua University from 2021-2022.)

- **Summary:** In microbiome studies, it is of interest to use a sample from a population of microbes, such as the gut microbiota community, to estimate the population proportion of these taxa. However, due to biases introduced in sampling and preprocessing steps, these observed taxa abundances may not reflect true taxa abundance patterns in the ecosystem. Repeated measures including longitudinal study designs may be potential solutions to mitigate the discrepancy between observed abundances and true underlying abundances. Yet, widely observed zero-inflation and over-dispersion issues can distort downstream statistical analyses aiming to associate taxa abundances with covariates of interest. We propose a Zero-Inflated Poisson Gamma (ZIPG) framework to address the aforementioned challenges. The above figure shows how the estimated differential variability of a taxon in pregnant women changes over age.

## Quantile TWAS Genome Browser (Shiny app)
- **Student's name:** Weijing Yin. (This work was conducted as a summer project in 2022 when Weijing was a sophomore at Tsinghua University.)

- **Summary:** This visualization is based on QTWAS, a quantile regression model for Transcriptome-wide Association Studies (TWAS). Here we provide QTWAS results on the summary statistics from ten GWAS studies on brain disorders, including five neuropsychiatric traits: schizophrenia (SCZ), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and major depressive disorder (MDD); and four neurodegenerative traits: Alzheimer’s disease (AD_Kunkle and AD_Jansen), Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
