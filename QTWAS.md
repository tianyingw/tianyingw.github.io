<img align="right" src="/img/QTWAS_flowchart.jpg" alt="" width="600">


### Methodology

  - Please see the manuscript ["A Unified Quantile Framework reveals nonlinear heterogeneous transcriptome-wide associations"]() for more details.

### Software

  The R package is on Github: [_QTWAS_]()

### Models

We provide pre-trained QTWAS models per gene for 49 tissues in GTEx v8. _R scores_ are also provided for each model.

  - Download R scores for each model [_here_]()

### Results

#### Ten psychiatric/disorder diseases 
    
  We perform QTWAS on the summary statistics from ten GWAS studies on brain disorders, including five neuropsychiatric traits: schizophrenia  (SCZ, from \cite{pardinas2018common}), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD from \cite{demontis2019discovery}), bipolar disorder (BD, from [@cite stahl2019genome]), autism spectrum disorder (ASD, from \cite{grove2019identification}) and major depressive disorder (MDD, from \cite{howard2019genome}); and four neurodegenerative traits: Alzheimer's disease (AD\_Kunkle from  \cite{kunkle2019genetic} and AD\_Jansen from \cite{jansen2019genome}), Parkinson's disease (PD, from \cite{nalls2019identification}), multiple sclerosis (MS, from \cite{andlauer2016novel}) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, from \cite{van2016genome}). Sample information for those studies is summarized in the Appendix (Table \ref{tab:gwas}).
