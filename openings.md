## For undergraduate students
<p align="justify">
If you are an undergraduate student at Tsinghua University and want to get research training experience in statistics, please email me to discuss possible research opportunities. Please include a short introduction of your background, your research interests, the statistical courses you took, and your expectation for this research experience.
</p>

#### Basic Requirements

- Students need to be **highly self-motivated** and good at communications;
- Coding skills: R (required), python (required for deep learning related projects);
- Good at paper reading (English);
- Have learned basic statistical courses already (e.g., probability theory, statistical inference, statistical computing, and linear model).

#### Student Responsibility

- Weekly one on one meetings;
- Maintain research progress log (Overleaf or Notion).

#### Note

- I prefer one on one meetings and **DO NOT organize any group meeting or reading group** now.
- Every student will be responsible for their own projects.
- All projects will run for at least 6 months. Early drop-out is not acceptable.
